Use Linux.



# Using the same computer for the leaderboard account and display

1. Use `nocache_serve` (a Python 3 script) to serve the html folder generated by PC^2:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/pc2/html
    path/to/nocache_serve
    ```

2. Open `file:///path/to/scoreboard_icpc/index.html?src=http://localhost:8000` in a browser. It should now work.



# Using different computers for the leaderboard account and display

Assume for example that the IP address of the PC^2 leaderboard account computer is 192.168.1.11. Then:

1. Do step 1 above in the leaderboard account computer, but use `cors_serve` instead of `nocache_serve`.

2. Do step 2 above in the leaderboard display computer, but use `?src=http://192.168.1.11:8000` instead.



# Using the same computer for the leaderboard account and display (the hacky method)

1. Copy all files in `scoreboard_icpc/` to the `pc2` folder.  

2. Run `./nocache_serve`.  

3. Open `http://localhost:8000/` :D

This will clutter the PC^2 folder, so please only do this on the scoreboard computer and not on judge/admin computers just to be safe.

You can make this less insane by not copying the `scoreboard_icpc/` files over, and instead running a script that continuously copies `pc2/html/index.html` to `scoreboard_icpc/html/` every 5 seconds or something. This is probably also the best way to serve it publicly, as long as you have a server that can serve static files and to which you can write to constantly.  



# Behind the hood

The thing works by reading off the `html/index.html` file produced by PC^2. Most of the setting up is just pointing it to where it can get this file.

In essence, it receives a URL param calle `?src=` which should be a valid URL which allows CORS (cross-origin resource sharing). It then fetches `/index.html` from that URL every 5 seconds or so. If `?src=` is not passed, then it defaults to `html/`.  

As long as you can serve the files statically here and are able to update `html/index.html` constantly (say by copying it over every few seconds), the `?src=` param will not be needed.
