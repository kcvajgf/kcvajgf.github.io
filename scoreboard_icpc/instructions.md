Use Linux.


# Using the same computer for the leaderboard account and display

1. Use `cors_serve` (a Python 3 script) to serve the html folder generated by PC2:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/pc2/html
    path/to/cors_serve
    ```

2. Open `scoreboard_icpc/index.html` in a browser. It should now work.


# Using different computers for the leaderboard account and display

Assume for example that the IP address of the PC^2 leaderboard account computer is 192.168.1.11 . Then:

1. Do step 1 above in the leaderboard account computer.

2. Do step 2 above in the leaderboard display computer, but add the string `?src=http://192.168.1.11:8000` in the URL when opening `scoreboard_icpc/index.html`.
