"Hole in Wall\n\nIt couldn't have been me.\nSee, the direction the spackle protrudes.\nA noisy neighbor? An angry boyfriend? I'll never know. I wasn't home.\nI peer inside for a clue.\nNo! I can't see. I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun.\nBut it's too late. My retinas.\nAlready scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image.\nIt's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright.\nIt was too deep.\nStretching forever into everything.\nA hole of infinite choices.\nI realize now, that I wasn't looking in.\nI was looking out.\nAnd he, on the other side, was looking in.\n\n- Monika",
"Eagles Can Fly\n\nMonkeys can climb\nCrickets can leap\nHorses can race\nOwls can seek\nCheetahs can run\nEagles can fly\nPeople can try\nBut that's about it.\n\n- Natsuki",
"Dear Sunshine\n\nThe way you glow through my blinds in the morning\nIt makes me feel like you missed me.\nKissing my forehead to help me out of bed.\nMaking me rub the sleepy from my eyes.\n\nAre you asking me to come out and play?\nAre you trusting me to wish away a rainy day?\nI look above. The sky is blue.\nIt's a secret, but I trust you too.\n\nIf it wasn't for you, I could sleep forever.\nBut I'm not mad.\n\nI want breakfast.\n\n- Sayori",
"Ghost Under the Light\n\nThe tendrils of my hair illuminate beneath the amber glow.\nBathing.\nIt must be this one.\nThe last remaining streetlight to have withstood the test of time.\nthe last yet to be replaced by the sickening blue-green hue of the future.\nI bathe. Calm; breathing air of the present but living in the past.\nThe light flickers.\nI flicker back.\n\n- Yuri"
